Star Rating limits the user in picking 1-5 stars, it doesn't allow them to pick 0 stars for logical reasons.

The framework I'm using is called Native Base: https://docs.nativebase.io/

The linting styling is eslint eslint-config-rallycoding

Both Extensions tasks have been completed!

Accessibility features: Tried my best with the colour scheme. Inserted a text to speech functionality. Added a decent amount of accessibility tags

Validation is done throughout, in the edit and add reviews section

Phew! Good Luck me!
